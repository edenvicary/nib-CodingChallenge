# NIB - Eden Vicary - Coding Challenge

Challenge details outlined in CodingChallenge.docx.

## Run

```
ruby run-app.rb
```

## Implementation notes

As far as the implementation theres some things that could be further developed
like the validation for available stock quantities doesn't consdier if you have
two line items for the same product type. The application is obviously brittle
to the format of the data.
